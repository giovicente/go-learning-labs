# Go Learning Labs

This project is my personal learning playground for the Go programming language. I am using two main study sources: the book The Go Programming Language by Donovan & Kernighan and the [intensive Go course for Java developers created by Raywall Malheiros](https://raywall.github.io/go/).

![The Go Programming Language](http://bit.ly/4fYjYqp)

My goal is to present all the code snippets from the book, as well as make each one executable. I will also present my own solutions to all the proposed exercises.

I am using artificial intelligence to create an augmented reading of the book. This concept was proposed by Elemar Junior, where the idea is to use AI for expanded analysis, to capture the authorâ€™s perspective, and to consider the historical context of each passage.

With this, I am also building a notebook of learnings.

In Elemarâ€™s own words:
> AI is not reading for me. Itâ€™s not a shortcut, itâ€™s not a replacement. Itâ€™s something else. Itâ€™s augmentation. Itâ€™s a companion for thinking. Itâ€™s like reading with someone by your side, who listens, nudges you with a question, or gives back an idea you didnâ€™t notice, but was there.

In addition, I am also presenting my proposed solutions to Raywallâ€™s challenges from his Go learning guide.

This project is a playground containing a compendium of Go code for learning purposes. Donâ€™t expect single-purpose responsibility or world-class package organization.

However, this is the starting point for me to create other repos and ideas in the future (those, yes, with the concern of organizing things in a professional way).

That said, I am already very mindful of producing good quality code, inspired by great references and examples, so that one day I can move from an aspirant to someone truly capable of producing professional-grade code.

The most important and fun part is the journey ðŸ¤“
